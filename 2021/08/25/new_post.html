<div class="w3-container">
<p>It was a long time ago when I last wrote something on this blog.</p>
<p>Mostly was due to the tedius process to add some new content, but now I ended up having some time to change the structure of the blog.<p>
<p>Of course the blog structure is not the only to blame...it takes me a lot of time to write a post, but to the above problem I can figure out a solution, for this one the only solution is to write more.</p>
<p>
I wanted to have the blog as simple as possible, with the possibility to deploy it everywhere I want in case I want to move it.<br>
Also should be easy to add new post or change them.<br>
So I ended up with a simple html static structure. The blog has only two files that serve as entry point: the index.html and view.html.<br>
The posts are organized into a directory structure like year/month/day.<br>
Every post is compose of two files: the post itself and an overview to be used in the main page.<p>
 
<p>The index.html and view.html shoul not be modified by a new post. The only file to modify is the main.html file that include the reference to the posts and eventually the latest post list.</p>
<p>All the infomation from post, list of post, contacts, ecc. are imported into the DOM by some small JS scripts:
<div class="w3-code jsHigh">
<pre>
$(function () {
  var includes = $('[data-include]')
  $.each(includes, function () {
    var file = $(this).data('include')
    $(this).load(file)
  })
})
</pre>
</div>

Include in the html looks like that:
<div class="w3-code htmlHigh">
<&zwj;div data-include_in="2021/08/25/new_post_overview.html"><&zwj;/div>
</div>

</p>
</div>
