<div class="w3-container">
<p>It was a long time ago when I last wrote something on this blog.</p>
<p>Mostly was due to the tedius process to add some new content, but now I ended up having some time to change the structure of the blog.<p>
<p>Of course the blog structure is not the only to blame...it takes me a lot of time to write a post, but to the above problem I can figure out a solution, for this one the only solution is to write more.</p>
<p>
I wanted to have the blog as simple as possible, with the possibility to deploy it everywhere I want in case I want move.<br>
Also should be easy to add new post or change them.<br>
So I ended up with a simple html static structure. The blog has only two files that serve as entry point: the index.html and view.html.<br>
The posts are organized into a directory structure like year/month/day.<br>
Every post is made in generally by two files: the post itself and an overview to be used in the main page.<p>
 
<p>The index.html and view.html shoul not be modified by a new post. The only file to modify is a short main.html file that include the reference to the post.</p>
<p>All the infomation from post, list of post, contacts, ecc. are imported into the DOM by some small JS scripts.</p>
