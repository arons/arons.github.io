<p>I want to share some thoughts and stuff I've done with my keyboards.</p>
<p>Some time ago I wanted to buy a new keyboard and since I spend a lot of time with it I think is worth to invest money on it.
Also I decided to go for a Mechanical one. I'm not really sure why. I think just because, once you start searching about keyboard on Internet, a new world open to you and you get lost in it.
After some search, I found out that a lot of people are obsessed by mechanical keyboard and I became really curious to try one.</p>
<p>Because I like also DIY, I  of course checked how it would be to build your own from scratch and realize that was not really interesting to me, it looks to me quite time-consuming and really expensive. </p>
<p>I decide then to first check if I like mechanical keyboard and I found quite good reviews about the <a href="https://www.durgod.com/">Durgod K32</a>. I think I bought from Amazon.</p>
<p>It is a really simple keyboard, I choose the one without backlight and with red silent switches. I really like the keyboard and I'm still using it at home.</p>
<p>After than one, cause I fall in love with mechanical keyboard, was a turn to buy another one for my work place. I opt of the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-ctrl-mechanical-keyboard">Drop CTRL</a>.
That because on that model is possible to change the switch at any time without desoldering them.</p>
<p>Next step was to update both keyboards with same layout.
  In order to do that I needed to install <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/durgod/k3x0/k320/readme.md">qmk_firmware</a> on my durgod (the drop already running the qmk_firmware),
  you can find the instruction to flash the firmware <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/durgod/k3x0/readme.md#initial-flash">here</a>.
</p>
I'm really happy with this setup. The durgod with red silence is the best for home working, especially during night session, it is really quiet.
