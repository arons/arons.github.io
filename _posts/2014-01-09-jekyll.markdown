This blog is based on [jekyll].
I've choose this option after I discover [github pages], where this blog is currently deployed.

With github pages you can publish your post with a simple 
{% highlight bash %} $ git push {% endhighlight %}

Githup is using jekyll to generate automatically static contest from Markdown post.
I was looking for a simple static blog generator, so, cause I like github, I decided to give it a try.

The first impression it that it looks quite simple,powerful and well used. 

Jekyll installation is quite simple:

 + install ruby and rubygems. Remember to add  in your path: {% highlight bash %} $(ruby -rubygems -e "puts Gem.user_dir")/bin {% endhighlight %}
 + install jekyll: {% highlight bash %} $ gem install jekyll -V {% endhighlight %}
 
Here jekyll quite start [guide](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).

After installation I generate my template using [bootstrap].
