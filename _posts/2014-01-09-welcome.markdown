This is my first post.

Why I decided to start a sort of blog? 
Don't really know the right answer. I think the most obvious is to share my current readings and findings, 
but also I think can be a nice way to index them.

Not really sure now how long I'll keep writing...hope this will be worth it.

p.s. it is also a good way to improve my English skills
