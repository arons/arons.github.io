<div class="w3-container">
<p>I was trying to set up a vpn server to allow multiple roadwarrior users in our company to access our internal network.<br>
We are using <a href="https://www.openswan.org/">openswan</a> installed on an <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/alix.htm">alix board</a>
and I found that there is bit of a lack of documentation about how to configure it on openswan.<br>
Specially we tried at first to set up a roadwarrior configuration with PSK and we discover that it is not possible to have simultaneous connection for different users.</p>
