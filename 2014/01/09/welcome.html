  <p>This is my first post.</p>
  <p>Why I decided to start a sort of blog? Don't really know the right answer. I think the most obvious is to share my current readings and findings, but also I think can be a nice way to index them.</p>
  <p>Not really sure now how long I'll keep writing...hope this will be worth it.</p>
  <p>p.s. it is also a good way to improve my English skills</p>
